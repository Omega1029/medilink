# 🏥 Health Connect (MediLink)

**Health Connect** (previously *MediLink*) is a responsive medical web application designed to enhance patient–provider interactions, improve healthcare accessibility, and support secure medical data management.
Developed as part of the **Software Engineering Project** at **Clark Atlanta University – Department of Cyber Physical Systems (Fall 2025)**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Health Connect provides a centralized digital platform for patients to manage their healthcare journey—from viewing lab results and requesting prescription refills to messaging their physicians securely.
It aims to bridge gaps in usability, accessibility, and regulatory compliance in modern medical applications.

### 🎯 Core Objectives

* Simplify patient–provider communication.
* Ensure **HIPAA-compliant** data storage and exchange.
* Integrate **AI-based insights** for summaries and anomaly detection.
* Deliver an intuitive and accessible user interface for patients and medical staff.

## 🧱 System Architecture

Health Connect follows a **modular full-stack architecture**, separating frontend, backend, and database layers for scalability and maintainability.

```
Frontend (ReactJS)
   ↓
Backend API (GoLang - REST)
   ↓
SQL Database (MySQL / PostgreSQL)
```

### 🖥️ Frontend

* **Framework:** ReactJS
* **UI Libraries:** TailwindCSS / Material UI
* **Routing:** React Router
* **State Management:** Redux Toolkit / Context API
* **Authentication:** JWT-based user sessions
* **Build Tool:** Vite or Create React App

### ⚙️ Backend

* **Language:** Go (Golang)
* **Framework:** Gin / Fiber (REST API)
* **Authentication:** JWT with middleware
* **Database ORM:** GORM
* **Encryption:** bcrypt for password hashing, AES for sensitive data
* **Testing:** Go’s native testing framework

### 🗄️ Database

* **Type:** SQL (MySQL or PostgreSQL)
* **Schema Highlights:**

  * `users`: patient & provider credentials
  * `appointments`: scheduling & predictive suggestions
  * `records`: medical records and summaries
  * `messages`: encrypted provider-patient communications

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Compliance

* Designed to comply with **HIPAA** and related U.S. healthcare data protection laws.
* End-to-end encryption for all communications and stored data.
* Access control and audit logging to ensure patient data integrity.

Would you like me to generate a **GitHub-ready version** (with markdown formatting, badges, and a setup guide for Go + React + SQL in Docker)? It would make it look professional for submission or publication.
